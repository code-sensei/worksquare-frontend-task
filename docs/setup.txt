DREAMDWELL ESTATES - SETUP

Getting started is simple:

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd worksquare
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

I built this with:
- Next.js/React
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

The app loads property data from a JSON file in the data folder. In a real app, this would come from an API.

All the visual components are in the components folder, and I've used Lorem Picsum for the property images with consistent seeds to maintain the same images between refreshes.
