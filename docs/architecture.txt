DREAMDWELL ESTATES - ARCHITECTURE

I built this real estate listings interface using Next.js and React, with Tailwind CSS for styling. The app uses React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management since the requirements were straightforward enough not to need Redux.

The project structure is simple:
- Components like PropertyCard, FilterBar, and Newsletter in the components folder
- Property data stored in a JSON file
- TypeScript interfaces to keep everything type-safe

For the UI, I went with a clean, responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop. The property cards display in a 1-column layout on mobile and 2-column on larger screens.

I added loading skeletons to improve the user experience during data fetching and made sure to handle empty states when filters return no results.

The filtering system uses client-side filtering for this demo, which gives immediate feedback as users adjust their criteria. In a production app with thousands of listings, we'd want to move this to the server side.

DELIBERATE UI IMPROVEMENTS

I made some intentional design choices that differ from the original mockup to improve usability and consistency:

1. Property Cards - Used a consistent horizontal layout for all property cards to improve readability and emphasize the property details. This also allows for better space utilization on different screen sizes.

2. Filter System - Implemented a more interactive filter bar with clearer visual cues for active states. Added smooth transitions between filter states to provide better feedback to users.

3. Responsive Design - Enhanced the responsive behavior beyond the original design to ensure a seamless experience across devices of all sizes, not just desktop.

4. Typography Hierarchy - Established a more consistent typography system throughout the application to improve readability and information hierarchy.

5. Image Handling - Implemented consistent image aspect ratios and loading states to prevent layout shifts and improve perceived performance.

6. Color Consistency - Maintained a more cohesive color palette throughout the interface to strengthen brand identity and improve visual harmony.
