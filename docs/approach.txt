DREAMDWELL ESTATES - APPROACH & IMPROVEMENTS

My approach to building this interface focused on creating something clean, responsive, and user-friendly. I built everything with components that can be easily reused and modified.

A few things I'd improve with more time:

1. The current filtering happens client-side, which is fine for this demo but wouldn't scale well with thousands of properties. I'd move this to the server for a real application.

2. The placeholder images from Lorem Picsum work great for a demo, but a production app would need proper image optimization to handle various property photo sizes and qualities.

3. I used basic React hooks for state management. For a larger app with more features, I might consider Context API or Redux.

4. To make the app more complete, I'd add features like:
   - Property favoriting
   - Map view for locations
   - More detailed property pages
   - User accounts and saved searches

5. For production, I'd also add proper testing, analytics, and accessibility improvements.
