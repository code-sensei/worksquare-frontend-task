AI USAGE DOCUMENTATION

Throughout the development process, AI was used as an assistant for:
1. Documentation tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming
2. Providing second opinions on implementation approaches
3. Suggesting alternative solutions when facing challenges
4. Offering advice on code organization and structure

All core application development, component creation, styling, and architecture decisions were made independently, with AI only playing a supportive role for auxiliary tasks. The vast majority of the codebase was manually developed without AI assistance.
